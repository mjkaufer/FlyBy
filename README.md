# FlyBy
A drone that live-tweets photos of what it sees.

## What's FlyBy?

FlyBy is an application which tweets what it sees. It's perfect for automated photography of large events, such as HackBCA! 

## Where Can I See These Awesome Pictures?

FlyBy posts its photos to [its twitter](http://twitter.com/HackBCAFlyBy). Check them out!

## How Does It Work?

FlyBy leverages twitter's API, along with a node module that lets us interface with the drone. Using some dark wizardry (and a huge nest of async calls), the drone is able to send photos it takes to its twitter page, for all to see and enjoy!
